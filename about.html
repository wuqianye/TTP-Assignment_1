    <h1>Pet Adoption</h1>
    <p>Every year, nearly three million pets are euthanized in the United States due to an abundance of pets 
        in animal shelters and too few resources able to take care of all of them. Furthermore, the current 
        pandemic has made matters worse. Less people are going to animal shelters and as a result, animal 
        shelters are becoming more and more overpopulated. Adopting an animal will really change their life 
        and change your own. One day you'll look back and realize it was one of the best decisions you ever made.</p>
